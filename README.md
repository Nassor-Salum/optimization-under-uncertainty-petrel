## 🛢️ Optimization, History Matching & Sensitivity Analysis in Petrel

### 📌 Overview
This project focuses on optimizing reservoir production under uncertainty, conducting history matching, and performing sensitivity analysis using Schlumberger’s **Petrel** software. The aim is to evaluate the impact of varying reservoir parameters such as **saturation levels** and **gas-oil ratio (GOR)** on production performance and to calibrate the model against historical production data.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Maximize production rates and cumulative recovery  
- Perform **history matching** to align simulation with real production data  
- Assess the effect of uncertain input parameters  
- Identify optimal operational settings through scenario testing  

---

### 🧰 Tools Used
- **Petrel** – For model setup, history matching, and scenario management  
- **Eclipse** – For running dynamic simulations and validating results  

---

### 🔬 Methodology
- Conducted **history matching** to align reservoir model with actual production data  
- Developed multiple reservoir scenarios by altering **saturation**, **porosity**, **permeability**, and **GOR**  
- Used Petrel’s **uncertainty and sensitivity analysis** tools to simulate and analyze production performance  
- Compared simulation results to identify conditions that maximize production under realistic uncertainty  

---

### ✅ Key Outcomes
- Successfully matched the model to historical production behavior  
- Identified **optimal parameter ranges** that enhance oil recovery  
- Evaluated **risk and uncertainty** for each scenario  
- Recommended the most effective strategy with **maximum economic potential**
