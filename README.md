## 🛢️ Optimization, History Matching & Sensitivity Analysis in Petrel

### 📌 Overview
This project focuses on optimizing reservoir production under uncertainty, conducting history matching, and performing sensitivity analysis using Schlumberger’s **Petrel** software. The aim is to evaluate the impact of varying reservoir parameters such as **saturation levels** and **gas-oil ratio (GOR)** on production performance and to calibrate the model against historical production data.

### 🔬 Methodology
- Conducted **history matching** to align reservoir model with actual production data  
- Developed multiple reservoir scenarios by altering **saturation**, **porosity**, **permeability**, and **GOR**  
- Used Petrel’s **uncertainty and sensitivity analysis** tools to simulate and analyze production performance  
- Compared simulation results to identify conditions that maximize production under realistic uncertainty
